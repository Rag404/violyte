# Project Violyte

Hello ! And welcome to this repo, where I try my best to make a 2D/3D image editor.

It's my experience with VFX software, but also the urge to have my own big coding project that lead me to start this project. Now let's hope I can make something decent while I still deal with school, life and motivation.

### The vision

I aim to make an image editor that blends layer-based and node-based editing.

I am still in computer science class learning to code properly, so to make this project's goals more realistic for me I chose to focus on making a simple image editor rather than a full animation software.

### Inspirations and experiences

_Please note that everything I'm saying here is based off my own experience and opinion. Keep in mind, I'm far from a professionnal or even a dedicated artist._

I am definitely still a visual enthusiast rather than a real artist, but I have used and tried a variety of tools over the few years of creating stuff in my spare time :
 - Mainly **[Panzoid gen4](https://panzoid.com/apps/gen4)**, which I love for its grounded workflow, with simple yet very permissive features that let me edit the core of every effect (with nodes and custom GLSL). Unfortunately it is still messy/buggy and lacks the bigger and more ready-to-use effects that tools like After Effects provide, as well as having almost no community or resources.
 - A bit of **Adobe After Effects**, which has all the tools needed for professionnals, but lacks node-based editing and sometimes has a frustrating workflow, feeling more like tinkering than organizing.
 - [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), which scares me. Having every imaginable feature is technically a pro, but for my personal use having that many tabs and settings is just distracting if not confusing.
 - Maybe also [Touchdesigner](https://derivative.ca/), which is fully node-based but is simply not designed for the kind of media I usually make.
